								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I'm an enthusiastic and driven sophomore, majoring in Statistics and Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, with a knack for challenging myself, be it through taking tough classes, personal projects or online courses. My goal is to make use of my skills to give back to society, which I hope to reflect through my projects and work.
							</br>	My passion lies in the fields of Data Science and Machine Learning, specifically in Deep Learning. To further my understanding of the field, I spent last summer as a Deep Learning Intern at Degirum, a disruptive startup in the bay area, and the exciting projects I've had a chance to work on there has further fueled my passion for the subject.    </br>Apart from college courses, I also take part in research under Professor Schneider. The past year, I worked on graphically representing semantic medical data using tools such as Neo4J, a graphical database management system. Based on my findings, I presented a poster at the Undergraduate Research Symposium last spring. I am currently working on writing a paper on Deep Learning that I hope to publish soon.</p>

								<h3> Research Poster </h3>
								<p>During my Freshman year, I researched different forms of graphical network representation for Semantic Medical Data using tools such as Neo4J under Professor Jodi Schneider. Along with two other fellow students, we presented our findings in the form of a Research Poster at the Undergraduate Research Symposium. </br> Click <a href="https://nitishnat.github.io/ResearchPosterFinal-2019.pdf">here</a> to view the poster.</p>
								<h3>Projects</h3>
								<h4>Readability</h4>
								<p>Readability is a mobile app designed to assist people with reading disabilities such as dyslexia. With the help of text extraction and text to speech capabilities, the user can capture a photo of the text in the app which is then displayed and read out. The pitch and speed of the audio can also be toggled allowing the user to listen to the text at a pace he or she is comfortable with. Readability was featured at a Computer Science fair at college as one of the best projects presented. I am currently working to improve the app by incoporating google translate, allowing for instant translation while reading text in a foreign language. </br> To view the code, click <a href="https://github.com/NitishNat/Readability">here.</a> </p>
								<h4>U of Fly</h4>
								<p>UofFly is an end to end travel solution which allows students at the University of Illinois â€” Urbana Champaign to get the most ideal route to get to their homes across the world. The app combines the schedules of Peoria Charter Bus Service to Chicago with flights out of O Hare International Airport, Chicago to find the most convenient combination of both. Through data analysis, the algorithm ranks flights based on cost, duration and fuel efficiency in the order of importance given by the user.</br> To view the code, click <a href="https://github.com/NitishNat/UofFly">here.</a></p>
							<h4>Smart Hands-Free Music Player</h4>
							<p>A music player designed to keep track of facial expressions using opencv libraries while playing your favorite songs. Through emotions recorded during the song, the app decides whether the user likes or dislikes the song. The music player has features such as fast-forwarding, pausing and playing songs purely through facial expressions such as winking and raising your eyebrows allowing for hands-free control. </br> To view the code, click <a  href="https://github.com/NitishNat/Emotion-Detecting-Hands-Free-Music-Player">here.</a></p>
